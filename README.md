# AndCat

AndCat is an Android application written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) that uses the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) framework. It's pretty prototypical.

You can do two things with AndCat: send TCP streams and receive TCP streams. This mean you can send files between any other device that's running AndCat, [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat), or any device that can use TCP sockets.

I made this to learn more about Kivy and to scratch a pain I've always had - transfering larger files from my computer to my phone or tablet. You can read more about how this happened on my [blog](http://mattscodecave.com/posts/a-web-developer-builds-a-kivy-app.html).

### Building

I'll make a release build of the app available on the Google Play store soon, for now you gotta build it by hand. If something's not working, there's some [good docs](https://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android.html).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
buildozer android debug
```
